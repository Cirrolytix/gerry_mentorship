## New Paragraph from Doc

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model.[1][2] A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.[3]

A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query such as "what is Fermat's little theorem?",[4] a command such as "write a poem about leaves falling",[5] or a longer statement including context, instructions,[6] and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style,[5] providing relevant context[7] or assigning a role to the AI such as "Act as a native French speaker".[8] A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the model to complete "maison → house, chat → cat, chien →" (the expected response being dog),[9] an approach called few-shot learning.[10]
