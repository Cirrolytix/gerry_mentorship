Summary

I was employed as an LGU staff (Personal Staff of the LCE) in a municipality here in western Samar, Philippinesfrom 2016-2023.
I took the scholarship program of DOST implemented by Development
academy of the Philippines (DAP) called SPARTA and just graduated this September as Analytics Manager with 3micro specialization pathway, namely: 1. Domain knowledge: Urban Planning Pathway, 2. Data Governance. and3. Computing.
Also I earned a certificate on Business Analytics Concept and Framework from The University of the PhilippinesOpen University (UPOU).

When I graduated in SPARTA I thought I will only be dealing with data analysis to be use in decission making within the business world exlcusively. But when I got the certificate of Business Analytics Concepts and Frameworks, all a sudden, I come into a recollection of my past engagement in Community Development, and latest, Local Governance. Now I'm aware of the Impact of AI in this two particular fields- it is a must in order for the Philippines to cope-up with the fast emerging economies of its neighbors, specifically ASEAN.

Data-driven decission-making will ease the burden of Poverty among Filipinos.
